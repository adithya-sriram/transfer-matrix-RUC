# transfer-matrix-RUC
 
This program will calculate operator correlation functions for noisy random unitary circuits. It implements a numerical transfer matrix method to evaluate a stat mech model mapping of the problem originally described in https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11544 and modified to incorporate depolarizing noise.
